# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

Overview of the analysis:

BigMarket will be advising SellBy if an investment in Amazon Vine memberships is worth the cost. The primary concern of SellBy is whether or not Vine members are biased in their reviews. Our task is to investigate this question and report our findings to SellBy.

Results: 

-We see that sixty reviews are from Vine members, while 14,477 reviews are not from Vine members.
-Thirty-four of the 60 Vine-member reviews are 5 stars, making the percentage of 5-star Vine-member reviews 56.67%.
-Meanwhile, 8,212 reviews from the 14,477 non-members are 5 stars. Non-member 5-star reviews are 56.72 percent.


Summary:

We began this analysis with an open mind about the possibility of bias within members of a rather exclusive group of reviewers. We were struck, though, at what seems to be a total lack of bias in Vine members. Our conclusion is that Amazon does a good job at selecting this group of super-reviewers, and that this is probably a worthy investment. We do have one concern. The number of Vine members is fairly minuscule compared to the total number of reviewers. Comparing the data of 60 members compared with 14,477 leaves us a little hungry for more data. As it stands, we would recommend this investment, but in the future we would like to see an increase in Vine membership.
